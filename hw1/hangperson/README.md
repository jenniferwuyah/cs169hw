Hangperson: a scaffolded (!) ESaaS getting-started assignment
=============================================================

** v1.0, January 2015.  Written by Armando Fox and Nick Herson **

In this assignment you'll be introduced to part of the basic cycle of creating SaaS in
a disciplined way.

The full Agile/XP cycle we follow in ESaaS includes talking to the
customer, using BDD to develop scenarios, turning those scenarios into
runnable integration/acceptance tests with Cucumber, using those
scenarios plus TDD to drive the creation of actual code, and deploying
the result of each iteration's work to the cloud.

In this introductory assignment, we've provided RSpec unit tests to let 
you use TDD to develop game logic
for the popular word-guessing game Hangman.  In the full Agile/XP cycle,
you'd develop these tests yourself as you code.

You'll then use the Sinatra framework to make the Hangman game available
as SaaS.  Adapting the game logic for SaaS will introduce you to
thinking about RESTful routes and service-oriented architecture.
As you develop the "SaaS-ified" Hangman game, you'll use Cucumber to
describe how gameplay will work from the player's point of view and as
"full stack" integration tests that will drive SaaS development.  In the
full Agile/XP cycle, you'd develop Cucumber scenarios yourself based on
consultation with the customer, and create the necessary *step
definitions* (Cucumber code
that turns plain-English scenarios into runnable tests).  In this
assignment we provide both the scenarios and step definitions for you.

You'll deploy your game to the cloud using Heroku, giving you experience
in automating SaaS deployment.

**Why Sinatra?** This assignment uses the simple Sinatra framework
rather than Rails, so 
that you can focus on tools, mechanics, and SaaS concepts, all of which
will readily map to Rails later.  Since our app doesn't have a database
and has very few functions, Sinatra is an easy way to get started.

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to be comfortable with the following concepts and skills:

* Basic Git usage and how to push your code to GitHub, as described in
Appendix A of *Engineering Software as a Service*.
 
* "Survival level" Unix command-line skills and facility with an editor
to edit code files.

* Basic concepts behind SaaS application architecture, as described in
Chapter 2 of *Engineering Software as a Service*.

Demystifying SaaS app creation
==============================

**Goal:** Understand the steps needed to create, version, and deploy a
SaaS app, including tracking the libraries it depends on so that your
production and development environments are as similar as possible.

**What you will do:** Create a simple "hello world" app using the
Sinatra framework, version it properly, and deploy it to Heroku.

Creating and versioning a simple SaaS app
-----------------------------------------

SaaS apps are developed on your computer but *deployed to production* on
a server that others can access.  We try to minimize the differences
between the development and production *environments*, to avoid
difficult-to-diagnose problems in which something works one way on your
development computer but a different way (or not at all) when that code
is deployed to production.

We have two mechanisms for keeping the development and production
environments consistent.  The first is *version control*, such as Git,
for the app's code.  But since almost all apps also rely on *libraries*
written by others, such as *gems* in the case of Ruby, we need a way to
keep track of which versions of which libraries our app has been tested
with, so that the same ones are used in development and production.

Happily, Ruby has a wonderful system for managing gem dependencies: a
gem called **Bundler** looks for a file called `Gemfile` in the *app
root directory* of each project.  `Gemfile` contains a list of gems and
versions your app depends on. Bundler verifies that those gems, and any
others that they in turn depend on, are properly installed on your
system and accessible to the app.

* Create a new empty directory to hold your new app, and use `git init`
in that directory to start versioning it with Git.

* In that directory, create a new file called `Gemfile` (the
capitalization is important) with the following contents.  This file
will be a permanent part of your app and will travel with your app
anywhere it goes:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
ruby '1.9.3'

gem 'sinatra', '>= 1.4'
```

The first line says that the preferred place to download any necessary
gems is https://rubygems.org, which is where the Ruby community
registers "production ready" gems.

The second line specifies which version of the Ruby language interpreter
is required.  If we omitted this line, Bundler wouldn't try to verify
which version of Ruby is available; there are subtle differences between
the versions, and not all gems work with all versions, so it's best to
specify this.

The last line says we need version 1.4 or later of the `sinatra` gem.
In some cases we don't need to specify which version of a gem we want;
in this case we do specify it because we rely on some features that are
absent from earlier versions of Sinatra.

Run Bundler
-----------

Run the command `bundle`, which examines your `Gemfile` to make
sure the correct gems (and, where specified, the correct versions) are
available, and tries to install them otherwise.  This will create a new
file `Gemfile.lock`, *which you should place under version control.*


* What's the difference between the purpose and contents of `Gemfile`
and `Gemfile.lock`?  Which file is needed to completely reproduce the
development environment's gems in the production environment?

> `Gemfile` specifies the gems you need and
> in some cases the constraints on which version(s) are acceptable.
> `Gemfile.lock` records the *actual* versions found, not only of the gems
>  you specified explicitly but also any other gems on which they
>  depend, so it is the file used by the production environment to
>  reproduce the gems available in the development environment.

* After running `bundle`, why are there gems listed in `Gemfile.lock`
that were not listed in `Gemfile`?

> Bundler looked up the information for each Gem you requested (in this
> case, only `sinatra`) and realized that it depends on other gems,
> which in turn depend on still others, so it recursively installed all
> those dependencies.  For example, the `rack` appserver is a gem, and
> while you didn't explicitly request it, `sinatra` depends on it.  This
> is an example of the power of automation: rather than requiring you
> (the app developer) to understand every Gem dependency, Bundler
> automates that process and lets you focus only on your app's top-level
> dependencies.

Create a simple SaaS app with Sinatra
-------------------------------------

As Chapter 2 of ESaaS explains, SaaS apps
require a web server to receive HTTP requests from the outside world,
and an application server that "connects" your app's logic to the web
server.  For development, we will use `webrick`, a very simple
Ruby-based web server that would be inappropriate for production but is
fine for development.  In both development and production, we will use 
the `rack` Ruby-based application server, which supports Ruby apps
written in various frameworks including Sinatra and Rails.

As Chapter 2 of *ESaaS* explains, a SaaS app essentially recognizes and
responds to HTTP requests corresponding to the application's *routes*
(recall that a route consists of an HTTP method such as `GET` or `POST`
plus a URI).  Sinatra provides an extremely lightweight shorthand for
matching a route with the app code to be executed when a request using
that route arrives from the Web server.

Create a file in your project called `app.rb` containing the following:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>"
  end
end
```

The `get` method is provided by the `Sinatra::Base` class, from which
our `MyApp` class inherits; `Sinatra::Base` is available because we load
the Sinatra library  in line 1.

* Self-check: What *two* steps did we take earlier to guarantee that the
Sinatra library is available to our app?

> We specified  `gem 'sinatra'`  in the `Gemfile` *and* successfully ran
> `bundle` to confirm that the gem is installed and "lock" the correct
> version of it in `Gemfile.lock`.

As you see from the above simple example, Sinatra lets you write
functions that match an incoming HTTP route, in this case `GET '/'`
(the root URL), a very simple HTML document containing 
the string `Hello World` will be returned
to the presentation tier as the result of the request.

To run our app, we have to start the
application server and presentation tier (web) server.  The `rack`
application server is controlled by a file `config.ru`, which you must
now create and version, containing the following:

```ruby
require './app'
run MyApp
```


The first line tells Rack that our app lives in the file `app.rb`, which
you created above to hold your app's code.  We have to explicitly state
that our `app` file is located in the current directory (.) because
`require` normally looks only in standard system directories to find
gems.

We're now ready to test-drive our simple app with this command line:

```bash
rackup
```

This command starts the Rack appserver and the WEBrick webserver.  Rack
will look for `config.ru` and attempt to start our app based on the
information there.  

* From the messages printed out by `rackup` as Rack is
starting, what URL should you type into your browser to communicate with
our running app?

>  `http://localhost:9292`, since it's running on your own machine
> (localhost) and by default `rack` should report that it's listening on
>  port 9292.

Point your Web browser at the running app and verify that you can get
"Hello World".

* What happens if you try to visit a non-root URL such as
`http://localhost:9292/hello` and why?

> You'll get a humorous error message from the Sinatra framework, since
> you don't have a route matching `get '/hello'` in your app.  Since
> Sinatra is a SaaS framework, the error message is packaged up in a Web
> page and delivered to your browser.

You should now have the following files under version control:
`Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`, `app.rb`, `config.ru`.  This is a minimal
SaaS app: the app file itself, the list of explicitly required gems, the
list of actual gems installed including the dependencies implied by the
required gems, and a configuration file telling the appserver how to
start the app.

Modify the app
--------------

Modify `app.rb` so that instead of "Hello World" it prints "Goodbye World".
Save your changes to `app.rb` and try visiting
that URL again.  

Confused?

Now go back to the shell window where you ran `rackup`
and press Ctrl-C to 
stop Rack.  Then type `rackup` again, and once it is running, go back to
your web browser and try the URL again.  This time it should work.

What this shows you is that if you modify your app while it's running,
you have to restart Rack in order for it to "see" those changes.  Since
restarting it manually is tedious, we'll use the `rerun` gem, which
restarts Rack automatically when it sees changes
to files in the app's directory.  (Rails does this for you
by default during development, as we'll see, but Sinatra doesn't.)

You're probably already thinking: "Aha! If our app depends on this
additional gem, we should add it to the `Gemfile` and run `bundle` to
make sure it's really present."  Good thinking.  But it may also occur
to you that this particular gem wouldn't be necessary in a production
environment: we only need it as a tool while developing.  Fortunately,
there's a way to tell Bundler that some gems are only necessary in
certain environments.  Add the following to the Gemfile (it doesn't
matter where):

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'rerun'
end
```
Any gem specifications inside the `group :development` block will only
be examined if `bundle` is run in the development environment.   (The
other environments you can specify are `:test` and `:production`, and
you can define new environments yourself.)
Gem specifications outside of any `group` block are assumed to apply
in all environments.

* Say `rerun rackup` in the terminal window to start your app and verify
the app is running.

* Modify `app.rb` to print a different message, and verify that the
change is detected by `rerun` and works as expected.

Deploy to Heroku
----------------

Make sure the Heroku Toolbelt is installed (when you create an account
on Heroku, a download link is provided).  Log in to your Heroku account
and create a new app; specify any name you want, but we will use
`sinatra-demo` in this discussion.

Follow the instructions that appear after app creation; you don't have
to do `git init` since you've been using Git to manage this simple app's
repo all along.

Deploy your app to Heroku and verify that going to
`http://sinatra-demo.herokuapp.com/` shows your Hello World page.

Summary
-------

* You started a new application project by creating a `Gemfile`
specifying which gems you need and running `bundle` to verify that
they're available and create the `Gemfile.lock` file that records the
versions of gems actually in use.

* You created a Sinatra app in the file `app.rb`, pointed Rack at
this file in `config.ru`, and used `rackup` to start the appserver and
the WEBrick web server.

* You learned that changing the app's code doesn't automatically cause
Rack to reload the app.  To save the work of restarting the app manually
every time you make a change, you used the `rerun` gem, adding it to the
Gemfile in a way that specifies you won't need it in production, only
during development.

* You versioned the important files containing not only your app's code
but the necessary info to reproduce all the libraries it relies on and
the file that starts up the app.

* You deployed this simple app to Heroku.

With this machinery in mind, download and unpack the homework skeleton
into a new directory and let's work on Hangperson.

Developing Hangperson Using TDD and Autotest
============================================

**Goals:** Use test-driven development (TDD) based on the tests we've
provided to develop the game logic for Hangman, which forces you to
think about what data is necessary to capture the game's state. This
will be important when you SaaS-ify the game in the next part.

**What you will do:**  Use `autotest`, our provided test cases will be
re-run each time you make a change to the app code.  One by one, the
tests will go from red (failing) to green (passing) as you create the
app code.  By the time you're done, you'll have a working Hangperson
game class, ready to be "wrapped" in SaaS using Sinatra.

Overview
--------

Our Web-based version of the popular game "hangman" works as follows:

* The computer picks a random word

* The player guesses letters in order to guess the word

* If the player guesses the word before making seven wrong guesses of
letters, they win; otherwise they lose.  (Guessing the same letter
repeatedly is simply ignored.)

To make the game fun to play, each time you start a new game the app
will actually retrieve a random English word from a remote server, so
every game will be different.  This feature will introduce you not only
to using an external service (the random-word generator) as a "building
block" in a **Service-Oriented Architecture**, but also how a Cucumber
scenario can test such an app deterministically with tests that
**break the dependency** on the external service at testing time.

* In the app's root directory, say `autotest`.  

This will fire up the Autotest framework, which looks for various files
to figure out what kind of app you're testing and what test framework
you're using.  In our case, it will discover the file called `.rspec`,
which contains RSpec options and indicates we're using the RSpec testing
framework.  Autotest will therefore look for test files under `spec/` and the
corresponding class files in `lib/`.

We've provided a set of 19 test cases to help you develop the game class.
Take a look at `spec/hangperson_game_spec.rb`.  It specifies behaviors
that it expects from the class `lib/hangperson_game.rb`.  
initially, we have added `:pending => true` to every spec, so when
Autotest first runs these, you should see the test case names printed
in yellow, and the report "19 examples, 19 pending."

Now, with Autotest still running, delete `:pending => true` from line 11, and
save the file.  You should immediately see Autotest wake up and re-run
the tests.  You should now have 3 failures and 16 pending examples.

The `describe 'new'` block means "the following block of tests describe
the behavior of a 'new' HangpersonGame instance."  The `subject` block
causes a new instance to be created, and the `its` blocks verify the
presence and values of instance variables.

* Self-check: According to our test cases, how many arguments does the
game class constructor expect, and therefore what will the first line of
the method definition look like that you must add to
`hangperson_game.rb`?

> One argument (in this example, "glorp"), and since constructors in
> Ruby are always named `initialize`, the first line will be
> `def initialize(new_word)` or something similar.

* Self-check: According to the tests in this `describe` block, what
instance variables is a HangpersonGame expected to have?

> @word, @guesses, and @wrong_guesses.

You'll need to create getters and setters for these.  Hint: use `attr_accessor`.
When you've done this successfully and saved `hangperson_game.rb`,
Autotest should wake up again and the three examples that were
previously failing should now be passing (green).

Continue in this manner, removing `:pending => true` from one example at
a time working your way down the specs, until you've implemented all the
instance methods of the game class: `guess`, which processes a guess and
modifies the instance variables `wrong_guesses` and `guesses`
accordingly; `check_win_or_lose`, which returns one of the symbols
`:win`, `:lose`, or `:play` depending on the current game state; and
`word_with_guesses`, which substitutes the correct guesses made so far
into the word.

* Debugging Tip: when running tests, you can insert the Ruby command
`debugger` into your app code to drop into the command-line debugger and
inspect variables and so on.  Type `h` for help at the debug prompt.
Type `c` to leave the debugger and continue running your code.

* Self-check: take a look at the code in the class method
`get_random_word`, which retrieves a random word from a Web service we found
that does just that.  Use the following command to verify that the Web
service actually works this way. Run it several times to verify that you
get different words.

`curl --data '' http://watchout4snakes.com/wo4snakes/Random/RandomWord`

(Normally the
argument to `--data` would be the encoded form fields, but in this case
no form fields are needed; however `--data` is necessary to force `curl`
to do a POST rather than a GET.) 
Using `curl` is a great way to experiment with/debug interactions with
external services.


RESTful thinking for HangPerson
=================================

**Goals:**  Understand how to expose your app's behaviors as RESTful
actions in a SaaS environment, and how to preserve game state across
(stateless) HTTP requests to your app using the appserver's provided
abstraction for cookies.

**What you will do:** Create a Sinatra app that makes use of the
HangpersonGame logic developed in the previous part, allowing you to
play Hangperson via  a browser.

Game State
----------

Unlike a shrinkwrapped app, SaaS runs over the stateless HTTP protocol,
with each HTTP request causing something to happen in the app.  And
because HTTP is stateless, we must think carefully about the following
2 questions:  

0. What is the total state needed in order for the next HTTP
request to pick up the game where the previous request left off?

0. What are the different game actions, and how should HTTP requests map
to those actions?


The widely-used mechanism for maintaining state between a
browser and a SaaS server is a **cookie**.  The server can put whatever
it wants in the cookie (up to a length limit of 4K bytes); the browser
promises to send the cookie back to the server on each subsequent
requests.  Since each user's browser gets its own cookie, the cookie can
effectively be used to maintain per-user state.

In most SaaS apps, the amount of information associated with a user's
session is too large to fit into the 4KB allowed in a cookie, so as
we'll see in Rails, the cookie information is more often used to hold a
pointer to state that lives in a database.  But for this simple example,
the game state is small enough that we can keep it directly in the
session cookie.

* Self-check question: enumerate the minimal game state that must be maintained
during a game of Hangperson.

> The secret word; the list of letters that have been guessed correctly;
> the list of letters that have been guessed incorrectly.  Conveniently,
> the well-factored HangpersonGame class encapsulates this state using
> its instance variables, as proper object-oriented design recommends.

The game as a RESTful resource
------------------------------

* Self-check questions: enumerate the player actions that could cause changes
in game state.

> Guess a letter: possibly modifies the lists of correct or incorrect
> guesses; possibly results in winning or losing the game.
>
> Start new game: chooses a new word and sets the incorrect and correct
> guess lists to empty.

In a service-oriented architecture, we do not expose
internal state directly; instead we expose a set of HTTP requests that
either display or perform some operation on a hypothetical
underlying **resource**.  The trickiest and most important part of
RESTful design is modeling what your resources are and what
operations are possible on them.

In our case, we can think of the game itself as the underlying
resource.  Doing so results in some important design decisions about how
routes (URLs) will map to actions and about the game code itself.  
Since we've already identified the game state and player actions that
could change it, it makes sense to define the game itself as a class.
An instance of that class is a game, and represents the resource being
manipulated by our SaaS app.

Mapping resource routes to HTTP requests
----------------------------------------

Our initial list of operations on the resource might look like this,
where we've also given a suggestive name to each action:

0. `create`: Create a new game
0. `show`: Show the status of the current game
0. `guess`: Guess a letter

* Self-check: for a good RESTful design, which of the resource operations
should be handled by HTTP GET and which ones should be handled by HTTP
POST?

> Operations handled with `GET` should not have side effects on the
> resource, so `show` can be handled by a `GET`, but `create` and `guess`
> (which modify game state) should use `POST`.  (In fact,
> in a true service-oriented architecture we can also choose to use other
> HTTP verbs like `PUT` and `DELETE`, but we won't cover that in this
> assignment.)

HTTP is a request-reply protocol and the Web browser is
fundamentally a request-reply user interface, so each action by the user
must result in something being displayed by the browser.  
For the "show status of current game" action, it's pretty clear that
what we should show is the HTML representation of the current game, as
the `word_with_guesses` method of our game class does.
(In a fancier implementation, we would
arrange to draw an image of part of the hanging person.)

But when the player guesses a letter--whether the guess is correct or
not--what should be the "HTML representation" of the result of that
action?

Answering this question is where the design of many Web apps falters.

In terms of game play, what probably makes most sense is after the
player submits a guess, display the new game state resulting from the
guess.  **But we already have a RESTful action for displaying the game
state.**  So we can plan to use an **HTTP redirect** to make use of that action.

This is an important distinction, because an HTTP redirect triggers an
entirely new HTTP request.  Since that new request does not "know" what
letter was guessed, all of the responsibility for **changing** the game
state is associated with the guess-a-letter RESTful action, and all of
the responsibility for **displaying** the current state of the game
without changing it is associated with the display-status action.  This
is quite different from a scenario in which the guess-a-letter action
**also** displays the game state, because in that case, the game-display
action would have access to what letter was guessed.  Good RESTful
design will keep these responsibilities separate, so that each RESTful
action does exactly one thing.

A similar argument applies to the create-new-game action.  The
responsibility of creating a new game object rests with that action (no
pun intended); but once the new game object is created, we already have
an action for displaying the current game state.

So we can start mapping our RESTful actions in terms of HTTP requests as
follows, using some simple URIs for the routes:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Route and action </th><th>  Resource operation</th> <th>  Web result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

<tr><td> `GET /show`      </td><td>   show game state      </td><td>  display correct & wrong guesses so far</td></tr>
<tr><td> `POST /guess`    </td><td>   update game state with new guessed letter </td><td> redirect to `show`</td></tr>
<tr><td> `POST /create`   </td><td>   create new game      </td><td>  redirect to `show`</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In a true service-oriented architecture, we'd be nearly done.  But a
site experienced through a Web browser is not quite a true
service-oriented architecture.

Why?  Because a human Web user needs a way to `POST` a form.  A `GET`
can be accomplished by just typing a URL into the browser's address bar,
but a `POST` can only happen when the user submits an HTML form (or, as
we'll see later, when AJAX code in JavaScript triggers an HTTP action).

So to start a new game, we actually need to provide the user a way to
post the form that will trigger the `POST /create` action.  You can
think of the resource in question as "the opportunity to create a new
game."  So we can add another row to our table of routes:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>`GET /new`   </td><td>  give human user a chance to start new game </td><td> display a form that includes a "start new game"  button  </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Similarly, how does the human user generate the `POST` for guessing a
new letter?  Since we already have an action for displaying the current
game state (`show`), it would be easy to include on that same HTML page
a "guess a letter" form that, when submitted, generates the `POST
/guess` action.

We will see this pattern mirrored later in Rails: a typical resource
(such as the information about a player) will have `create` and `update`
operations, but to allow a human being to provide the data used to
create or update a player record, we will have to provide `new` and
`edit` actions respectively that allow the user to enter the information
on an HTML form.

* Self-check: why is it appropriate for the `new` action to use
`GET` rather than `POST`?  

> The `new` action doesn't by itself cause any state change: it just
> returns a form that the player can submit.

* Self-check: explain why the `GET /new` action wouldn't be needed if
your Hangperson game was called as a service in a true service-oriented
architecture. 

> In a true SOA, the service that calls Hangperson can generate an HTTP
> `POST` request directly.  The only reason for the `new` action is to
> provide the human Web user a way to generate that request.

Lastly, when the game is over (whether win or lose), we shouldn't be
accepting any more guesses.  Since we're planning for our `show` page to
include a letter-guess form, perhaps we should have a different type of
`show` action when the game has ended---one that does **not** include a
way for the player to guess a letter, but (perhaps) does include a
button to start a new game.  We can even have separate pages for winning
and losing, both of which give the player the chance to start a new
game.  Since the `show` action can certainly tell if the game is over,
it can conditionally redirect to the `win` or `lose` action when called.

* Self-check(*): show the route for each of the RESTful actions in the
game, based on the description of what the route should do; we've
provided the first one.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Show game state, allow player to enter guess; may redirect to Win or
Lose  </td>
<td>GET /show</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display form that can generate `POST /create`   </td><td>  GET /new</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Start new game; redirects to Show Game after changing
state</td><td>  POST /create</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Process guess; redirects to Show Game after changing state </td><td>POST
/guess</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Show "you win" page with button to start new game </td><td>GET
/win</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Show "you lose" page with button to start new game </td><td>GET
/lose</td></tr>
</table>


## Summary of the design

You may be itchy about not writing any code yet, but you have finished
the most difficult and important task: defining the application's basic
resources and how the RESTful routes will map them to actions in a SaaS
app.  To summarize:

* We already have a class to encapsulate the game itself, with instance
variables that capture the game's essential state and instance methods
that operate on it when the player makes guesses.  In the
model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm, this is our model.

* Using Sinatra, we will expose operations on the model via
RESTful HTTP requests.  In MVC, this is our controller.

* We will create HTML views and forms to represent the game state, to
allow submitting a guess, to allow starting a new game, and to display a
message when the player wins or loses.  In MVC, these are our views.

Note that Sinatra does not really enforce MVC or any other design pattern---if
anything,  it's closest to the Page Controller pattern, where we
explicitly match up each RESTful request with an HTML view---but it's a
simple enough framework that we can use it to implement MVC in this
app since we have only one model.  As we'll see later, more powerful
MVC-focused frameworks like Rails are much more productive for creating
apps that have many types of models.

Connecting HangpersonGame to Sinatra
------------------------------------

You've already met Sinatra.  Here's what's new in the Sinatra app
skeleton `app.rb` that we provide for Hangperson:

* `before do...end` is a block of code executed *before* every SaaS
request

* `after do...end` is executed *after* every SaaS request
 
* The calls  `erb :`*action* cause Sinatra to look for the file
`views/`*action*`.erb` and run them through the Embedded Ruby processor,
which looks for constructions `<%= like this %>`, executes the Ruby code
inside, and substitutes the result.  The code is executed in the same
context as the call to `erb`, so the code can "see" any instance
variables set up in the `get` or `post` blocks.

* Self-check: `@game` in this context is an instance variable of what
class?  (Careful-- tricky!)

The Session
-----------

We've already identified the items necessary to maintain game state, and
encapsulated them in the game class.
Since HTTP is stateless, when a new HTTP request comes in, there is no
notion of the "current game".  What we need to do, therefore, is save the game
object in some way between requests.

If the game object were large, we'd probably store it in a database on
the server, and place an identifier to the correct database record into
the cookie.  (In fact, as we'll see, this is exactly what Rails apps
do.)
But since our game state is small, we can just put the whole
thing in the cookie.  Sinatra's `session` library lets us do this: in
the context of the Sinatra app, anything we place into the special
"magic" hash `session[]` is preserved across requests.  In fact,
objects placed there are *serialized* into a text-friendly form that is
preserved for us.  This behavior is switched on by the Sinatra call
`enable :sessions` in `app.rb`.

There is one other session-like object we will use.  In some cases
above, one action will perform some state change and then redirect to
another action, such as when the Guess action (triggered by `POST
/guess`) redirects to the Show action (`GET /show`) to redisplay the
game state after each guess.  But what if the Guess action wants to
display a message to the player, such as to inform them that they have
erroneously repeated a guess?  The problem is that since every request
is stateless, we need to get that message "across" the redirect, just as
we need to preserve game state "across" HTTP requests.

To do this, we use the `sinatra-flash` gem, which you can see in the
Gemfile.  `flash[]` is a hash for remembering short messages that
persist until the *very next* request (usually a redirect), and are then
erased. 

* Self-check: Why does this save work compared to just storing those
messages in the `session[]` hash?

> When we put something in `session[]` it stays there until we delete
> it.  The common case for a message that must survive a redirect is
> that it should only be shown once; `flash[]` includes the extra
> functionality of erasing the messages after the next request.

Running the Sinatra app
-----------------------

As before, run the shell command `rackup` to start the app, or `rerun
rackup` if you want to rerun the app each time you make a code change.  

* Self-check: based on the output from running this command, what is the
full URL you need to visit in order to visit the New Game page?

> The web server connected to Sinatra is listening on port 9292 of your
> computer, so the hostname part of the URL is `http://localhost:9292`.
> The Ruby code `get '/new' do...` in `app.rb` renders the New Game
> page, so the full URL is `http://localhost:9292/new`.

Visit this URL and verify that the Start New Game page appears. 

* Self-check: where is the HTML code for this page?

> It's in `views/new.erb`, which is processed into HTML by the `erb
> :new` directive.

Verify that when you click the New Game button, you get an error.  This
is because we've deliberately left the `<form>` that encloses this
button incomplete: we haven't specified where the form should post to.
We'll do that next, but we'll do it in a test-driven way.

* Commit all your changes, then deploy to Heroku.  Verify that the
Heroku-deployed Hangperson behaves the same as your development version
before continuing.


Introducing Cucumber
====================

Cucumber is a remarkable tool for writing high-level integration and
acceptance tests, terms with which you're already familiar.  We'll learn
much more about Cucumber later, but for now we will use it to *drive*
the development of your app's code.

Just as you used RSpec to "drive" the creation of the class's methods,
you'll next use Cucumber to drive the creation of the SaaS code.

Normally, the cycle would be:

0. Use Cucumber scenario to express end-to-end behavior of a scenario
0. As you start writing the code to make each step of the scenario pass, use RSpec to
drive the creation of that step's code
0. Repeat until all scenario steps are passing green

In this assignment we're skipping the middle step since the goal is to
give you an overview of all parts of the process.  Also, in the first
step, for your own apps you'd be creating the Cucumber scenarios
yourself; in this assignment we've provided them for you.

Cucumber lets you express integration-test scenarios, which you'll find
in the `features` directory in `.feature` files. You'll also see a
`step_definitions` subdirectory with a single file `game_steps.rb`,
containing the code used when each "step" in a scenario is executed as
part of the test.


As an integration testing tool,
Cucumber can be used to test almost any kind of software system as long
as there is a way to *simulate* the system and a way to *inspect* the
system's behavior.  
You select a *back end* for Cucumber based on how the end system is to
be simulated and inspected.

Since a SaaS server is simulated by issuing HTTP
requests, and its behavior can be inspected by looking at the HTML pages
served, we configure Cucumber to use 
[Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara), a 
Ruby-based browser simulator that includes a domain-specific language
for simulating browser actions and inspecting the SaaS server's
responses to those actions.

* Self-check: read the section on "Using Capybara with Cucumber" on
Capybara's home page.  Which step definitions use Capybara to simulate
the server as a browser would?  Which step definitions use Capybara to
inspect the app's response to the stimulus?

> Step definitions that use `visit`, `click_button`, `fill_in` are
> simulating a browser by visiting a page and/or filling in a form on
> that page and clicking its buttons.  Those that use `have_content` are
> inspecting the output.

* Self-check: Looking at `features/guess.feature`, what is the
role of the three lines following the "Feature:" heading?

> They are comments showing the purpose and actors of this story.
> Cucumber won't execute them.

* Self-check: In the same file, looking at the scenario step `Given I
start a new game with word "garply"`, what lines in `game_steps.rb` will
be invoked when Cucumber tries to execute this step, and what is the
role of the string `"garply"` in the step?

> Lines 13-16 of the file will execute.  Since a step is chosen by
> matching a regular expression, `word` will match the first (and in
> this case only) parenthesis capture group in the regexp, which in this
> example is `garply`.

## Get your first scenario to pass

We'll first get the "I start a new game" scenario to pass; you'll then
use the same techniques to make the other scenarios pass, thereby
completing the app.  So take a look at the step definition for "I start
a new game with word...".

You already saw that you can load the new game page, but get an error
when clicking the button for actually creating a new game.  You'll now
reproduce this behavior with a Cuke scenario.

* Self-check: When the "browser simulator" in Capybara issues the `visit
'/new'` request, Capybara will do an HTTP GET to the partial URL `/new` on the
app.  Why do you think `visit` always does a GET, rather than giving the
option to do either a GET or a POST in a given step?

> Cucumber/Capybara is only supposed to be able to do what a human user
> can do.  As we discussed earlier, the only way a human user can cause
> a POST to happen via a web browser is submitting an HTML form, which
> is accomplished by `click_button` in Capybara.

Run the "new game" scenario with:

```bash
cucumber features/start_new_game.feature
```

The scenario fails because the `<form>` tag in `views/new.erb` is missing the
information that tells the browser what URL to post the form to.  Based
on the table of routes we developed in an earlier section, fill in the
`<form>` tag's attributes appropriately, and add the necessary code to
the Sinatra app to recognize this route.  (Hint: if you get stuck, take
a look at `show.erb` for a similar example.)

The create-new-game code in the Sinatra app should do the following:

* Call the HangpersonGame class method `get_random_word`

* Create a new instance of HangpersonGame using that word

* Redirect the browser to the `show` action

When you finish this task, you should be able to re-run the scenario and
have all steps passing green.  

At that point, deploy to Heroku again and manually verify this behavior.

* Self-check: What is the significance of using `Given` vs. `When`
vs. `Then` in the feature file?  What happens if you switch them around?
Conduct a simple experiment to find out, then confirm your results by
using the Google.

> The keywords are all aliases for the same method.  Which one you use
> is determined by what makes the scenario most readable.



Develop the scenario for guessing a letter
-------------------------------------------

For this scenario, in `features/guess.feature`, we've already provided a
correct 
`show.erb` HTML file that submits the player's guess to the `guess`
action.  You already have a `HangpersonGame#guess` instance method that
has the needed functionality.  

* Self-check: In `game_steps.rb`, look at the code for "I start a new
game..." step, and in particular the `stub_request` command.  Given the
hint that that command is provided by a Gem (library) called `webmock`,
what's going on with that line, and why is it needed?  (Use the Google
if needed.)

> Webmock lets our tests "intercept" HTTP requests coming **from** our
> app and directed to another service.  In this case, it's intercepting
> the POST request (the same one you manually did with `curl` in an
> earlier part of the assignment) and faking the reply value.  This lets
> us enforce deterministic behavior of our tests, and also means we're
> not hitting the real external server each time our test runs.

The special Sinatra hash `params[]` has a key-value pair for each
nonblank field on a submitted form: the key is the symbolized `name`
attribute of the form field and the value is what the user typed into
that field, or in the case of a checkbox or radiobutton, the
browser-specified values indicating if it's checked or unchecked.
("Symbolized" means the string is converted to a symbol, so `"foo"`
becomes `:foo`.)

* Self-check: In your Sinatra code for processing a guess, what
expression would should you use to extract *just the first character* of
what the user typed in the letter-guess field of the form in `show.erb`?
**CAUTION:** if the user typed nothing, there won't be any matching
key in `params[]`, so dereferencing the form field will give `nil`.  In
that case, your code should return the empty string rather than an
error.

> `params[:guess].to_s[0]` or its equivalent.  `to_s` converts `nil` to
> the empty string in case the form field was left blank (and therefore
> not included in `params` at all).   `[0]` grabs the first character
> only; for an empty string, it returns an empty string.

In the `guess` code in the Sinatra app,
you should:

* Extract the letter submitted on the form.  

* Use that letter as a guess on the current game.

* Redirect to the `show` action so the player can see the result of
their guess.

Develop that code and verify that all the steps in
`features/guess.feature` now pass.

* Debugging tip: The Capybara command `save_and_open_page` placed in a
step definition will cause the step to open a Web browser window showing
what the page looks like at that point in the scenario.  The
functionality is provided in part by a gem called `launchy` which is in
the Gemfile.

Corner Cases
============

By now you should be familiar with the cycle:

0.  Pick a new scenario to work on
0.  Run the scenario and watch it fail
0.  Develop code that makes each step of the scenario pass
0.  Repeat till all steps passing.

Use this process to develop the code for the remaining actions `win` and
`lose`.  You will need to add code to the `show` action that checks
whether the game state it is about to show is actually a winning or
losing state, and if so, it should redirect to the appropriate `win` or
`lose` action.  Recall that your game logic model has a method for
testing if the current game state is win, lose, or keep playing.
The scenario `game_over.feature` tests these behaviors in your SaaS app.

Push to Heroku and make sure everything still works.  Give yourself a
break and play a few rounds of hangperson.

While you're playing, what happens if you directly go to
`http://localhost:9292/win`?  Make sure the player cannot cheat by
simply visiting `GET /win`.  The scenario `prevent_cheating.feature`
tests these behaviors.

* What to submit:  Make sure all Cucumber scenarios are passing.  A
shorthand way to run all of them is `cucumber features/` which runs all
`.feature` files in the given directory.  When all are passing, deploy
to Heroku and submit the URL of your deployed game.

Conclusion
==========

This assignment has served as a microcosm or miniature tour of the
entire course: during the rest of the course we will investigate each of
these in much more detail, and we will also add new techniques---

* *Test-driven development (TDD)* will let you write much more
detailed tests for your code and determine its **coverage**, that is,
how thoroughly your tests exercise your code.  We will use **RSpec** to
do test-first development, in which we write tests before we write the
code, watch the test fail ("red"), quickly write just enough code to make the
test pass ("green"), clean up (refactor) the code, and go on to the next test.  We
will use the `autotest` tool to help us get into a rhythm of red--green--refactor.
In this assignment we provided the specs for you; when designing your
own app, you'll write them yourself.

* *Code metrics* will give us insight into the quality of our code: is
it concise?  Is it factored in a way that minimizes the cost of making
changes and enhancements?  Does a particular class try to do too much
(or too little)?  We will use **CodeClimate** (among other tools) to
help us understand the answers.  We can check both quantitative metrics,
such as test coverage and complexity of a single method, and qualitative
ones, such as adherence to the *SOLID Principles* of object-oriented
design.

* *Refactoring* means modifying the structure of your code to improve
its quality (maintainability, readability, modifiability) while
preserving its behavior.  We will learn to identify *antipatterns* --
warning signs of deteriorating quality in your code -- and opportunities
to fix them, sometimes by applying *design patterns* that have emerged
as "templates" capturing an effective solution to a class of similar
problems. 

# Optional challenge assignment


Verify that a file exists on the courseware VM called
`/usr/share/dict/words`.  What's in it?

> This file has been part of Unix since almost 
> [the beginning of time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), 
> although it 
> [has moved around](http://objectroot.org/articles/brief-history-of-hier/) 
> since then.  It has been used by programs ranging from spelling
> checkers to password guessers.

Why do you think we used a remote SOA endpoint to generate random words
for Hangperson rather than `/usr/share/dict/words`?  (Hint: It's not
simply to give you an initial taste of using SOA.)

> In many hosted deployment environments, you cannot rely on the
> presence of the local filesystem, and in shared environments such as
> Heroku you may not have access to the filesystem at all.  All state
> must be stored in managed storage such as a database or other per-app
> abstraction, or managed on remote servers.


Using Sinatra, create and deploy locally (on your computer) a *SOA
endpoint* that mimics the behavior of the Random Word Generator service
we used in this assignment.  A simple implementation would respond to the
RESTful request `GET /` with a random word drawn randomly from
`/usr/share/dict/words`.
